## Predict deforestation due to expansion of roads/cities  - APPROVED
Due to exponential increase in human population, cities expand to establish infrastructure. Deforestation takes place as the roads continue to extend, and this may have a negative impact on the environment. Using GIS, we can predict the amount of deforestation that can happen due to a newly proposed road construction project. We digitize the road in ArcMap to predict how much deforestation it may cause, and this may allow to take important decisions, prior to starting the road construction project.
